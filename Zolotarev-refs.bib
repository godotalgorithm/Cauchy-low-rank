@article{Moussa_2019,
	abstract = {As electronic structure simulations continue to grow in size, the system-size scaling of computational costs increases in importance relative to cost prefactors. Presently, linear-scaling costs for three-dimensional systems are only attained by localized or randomized algorithms that have large cost prefactors in the difficult regime of low-temperature metals. Using large copper clusters in a minimal-basis semiempirical model as our reference system, we study the costs of these algorithms relative to a conventional cubic-scaling algorithm using matrix diagonalization and a recent quadratic-scaling algorithm using sparse matrix factorization and rational function approximation. The linear-scaling algorithms are competitive at the high temperatures relevant for warm dense matter, but their cost prefactors are prohibitive near ambient temperatures. To further reduce costs, we consider hybridized algorithms that combine localized and randomized algorithms. While simple hybridized algorithms do not improve performance, more sophisticated algorithms using recent concepts from structured linear algebra show promising initial performance results on a simple-cubic orthogonal tight-binding model.},

@article{BEYLKIN2010131,
	abstract = {We revisit the efficient approximation of functions by sums of exponentials or Gaussians in Beylkin and Monz{\'o}n (2005) [16] to discuss several new results and applications of these approximations. By using the Poisson summation to discretize integral representations of e.g., power functions r‚àíŒ≤, Œ≤>0, we obtain approximations with uniform relative error on the whole real line. Our approach is applicable to a class of functions and, in particular, yields a separated representation for the function e‚àíxy. As a result, we obtain sharper error estimates and a simpler method to derive trapezoidal-type quadratures valid on finite intervals. We also introduce a new reduction algorithm for the case where our representation has an excessive number of terms with small exponents. As an application of these new estimates, we simplify and improve previous results on separated representations of operators with radial kernels. For any finite but arbitrary accuracy, we obtain new separated representations of solutions of Laplace's equation satisfying boundary conditions on the half-space or the sphere. These representations inherit a multiresolution structure from the Gaussian approximation leading to fast algorithms for the evaluation of the solutions. In the case of the sphere, our approach provides a foundation for a new multiresolution approach to evaluating and estimating models of gravitational potentials used for satellite orbit computations.},

@article{doi:10.1137/0732009,
	abstract = { In relation to the determination of optimal parameters for the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method, the authors consider the third Zolotarev problem in the complex plane, which has been the topic of several recent contributions. In the real case, Zolotarev also posed a fourth problem that involves best rational approximants in the Chebyshev sense, and Achieser proved later that the third and fourth Zolotarev problems are actually equivalent. By generalizing Achieser's argument, it is shown that the complex third Zolotarev problem can be stated as a best Chebyshev approximation by complex rational functions. This enables the authors to use known optimality and uniqueness conditions as well as an iterative algorithm for computing the exact solutions. Some numerical results are reported for rectangular domains of the complex plane that are of practical importance in the ADI method. },

@article{10.1063/1.4855255,
	abstract = {The random-phase approximation with second-order screened exchange (RPA+SOSEX) is a model of electron correlation energy with two caveats: its accuracy depends on an arbitrary choice of mean field, and it scales as \$\\mathcal \{O\}(n^5)\$O(n5) operations and \$\\mathcal \{O\}(n^3)\$O(n3) memory for n electrons. We derive a new algorithm that reduces its scaling to \$\\mathcal \{O\}(n^3)\$O(n3) operations and \$\\mathcal \{O\}(n^2)\$O(n2) memory using controlled approximations and a new self-consistent field that approximates Brueckner coupled-cluster doubles theory with RPA+SOSEX, referred to as Brueckner RPA theory. The algorithm comparably reduces the scaling of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory with smaller cost prefactors than RPA+SOSEX. Within a semiempirical model, we study H2 dissociation to test accuracy and Hn rings to verify scaling.},
