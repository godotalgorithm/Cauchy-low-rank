This is a small info dump of an incomplete numerical experiment on directly constructing an exponential sum approximation of the Cauchy kernel from an interpolative decomposition,
 in case someone is interested and wants to collaborate before I finish it eventually
 (when I eventually need this for finite-temperature quantum many body calculations using path integrals).

Mainly, I need to work out the details of a speculative error analysis before I can fine-tune an exponential sum approximation
 that I expect to be comparable in accuracy to more established interpolative decompositions.
